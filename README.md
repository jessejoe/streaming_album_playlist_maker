# Streaming Album Playlist Maker

This is a script to take a file containing a list of album names, and creates a playlist of them on music streaming services (i.e. Spotify).

I often find "best of" lists that I want to create a playlist of, or I want to make a playlist of an artist's studio discography. It's tedious searching and adding album after album, so this automates it for you. I couldn't find something like this out there already.

## Spotify

Currently only Spotify is supported, but the tool is written to be easily expandable for other services (feel free to contribute!).

## Authentication

You will need to create an application in the [Spotify Developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications) in order to generate your own Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI to use with this script. See [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/tutorial/) for more information.

The script uses the [Spotipy python client library](http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for most of the real work. The first time you run the script it should launch a browser window and prompt you to give your application (this script using your keys) permission to be able to create public playlists. See the [Spotipy docs on Authorization](http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authorized-requests) for more details.

# Requirements

You will need to install the libraries in the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the script

See the `--help`:
```
$ ./streaming_album_playlist_maker.py --help
Usage: create_playlist.py [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE COMMAND [ARGS]...

  This script will take a list of album names from INPUT_FILE and create a
  playlist of all their tracks

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  spotify  Create playlist for Spotify See...
```

As mentioned, the script is written to work with multiple services, each of which most likely would support different options, and are provided as the command after the input filename. To see the help for a command:
```
$ ./streaming_album_playlist_maker.py input.txt spotify --help
Usage: create_playlist.py spotify [OPTIONS]

  Create playlist for Spotify

  See https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/tutorial/ for how to register an
  application to get a client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri

Options:
  --username TEXT       Spotify username to create the playlist with
                        [required]
  --client_id TEXT      Client ID from your appplication, can be set with env
                        var SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID  [required]
  --client_secret TEXT  Client Secret from your application, can be set with
                        env var SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET  [required]
  --redirect_uri TEXT   A whitelisted Redirect URI for your application, can
                        be set with env var SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI  [default:
                        https://example.com/callback/]
  --playlist_name TEXT  Name of playlist to create  [required]
  -h, --help            Show this message and exit.
```

Create a text file with a list of album names (1 per line) called `input.txt`. Ran the script with all the parameters for your application substituted:
```
$ ./streaming_album_playlist_maker.py input.txt spotify --username my_username --client_id 12345 --client_secret ABCDE --playlist_name '39 essential albums for audiophiles'
```

# Example

Using the list from http://www.stuff.tv/features/39-essential-albums-audiophiles create a file called `input.txt` containing the following:
```
Radiohead A Moon Shaped Pool
Nirvana In Utero 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition
Interpol Turn On The Bright Lights The Tenth Anniversary Edition
My Bloody Valentine Loveless
Dr Dre 2001
Marvin Gaye What’s Going On
Nirvana MTV Unplugged in New York
The Beatles Abbey Road
Bon Iver Bon Iver
R.E.M. Automatic for the People
Dusty Springfield Dusty in Memphis
Burial Untrue
The Flaming Lips The Soft Bulletin
The xx xx
Rage Against The Machine Rage Against The Machine
Jay-Z The Blueprint
Animal Collective Merriweather Post Pavilion
Fleetwood Mac Rumours
OutKast Speakerboxxx/The Love Below
Steely Dan Aja
Joni Mitchell Blue
Daft Punk Random Access Memories
Miles Davis Kind of Blue
Sigur Ros Agaetis Byrjun
Neil Young After The Gold Rush
Radiohead OK Computer
Prince Sign o’ the Times
The Congos Heart Of The Congos

Massive Attack Mezzanine
Underworld Second Toughest in the Infants
Slint Spiderland
Phil Collins Hello, I Must Be Going
Love Forever Changes
My Morning Jacket It Still Moves
Isis Panopticon
Manic Street Preachers The Holy Bible
```

The script will only look for albums, so putting the artist on the line will help make sure the correct album is found when searching.

Run the script:
```
./create_playlist.py input.txt spotify --username my_username --client_id 12345 --client_secret ABCDE --playlist_name '39 essential albums for audiophiles'
```

The script should run with the following output:
```

# Notes

The script does as much batching as possible for looking up album tracks and adding tracks to playlists, however there is no API for batch searching. It's possible to get rate limited if you hit the API too frequently. As shown above, I've been able to run the script with 38 albums and 684 tracks without issue, so I have not added any logic for honoring Spotify's [rate limiting](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/user-guide/#rate-limiting) or `Retry-After` headers.
